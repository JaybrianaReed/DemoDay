     <p style="color: LawnGreen">When i first joined Englewood codes i knew it was going to be interesting. I have learned a lot about html,JavaScript,css and bootstrap 2 & 3.Englewood Codes is a very good program for students that want to learn how to code very well. I have had a lot of fun times in Englewood Codes.I also enjoy Leadership we get to discuss a lot of good and bad things about Englewood and whatwe think about our own community.I have met a lot of nice people in this program as well. Englewood Codes have taught me a lot throughout this program.</p>
